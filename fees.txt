Q's for M. 
1. Do I list fees for accompaniment and prepartion of practise tapes for competitions etc or are we solely focusing on gettign the tutoring off the ground before we diversify into accompanying etc.
2. What do you think of the fee structure?  I need to do some research into what other people around me are charging to make sure that I am on or near the money.
3. Why isn't there spell check on this text editor? You mean I have to learn how to spell correctly?? No fair.
