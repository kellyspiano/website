	<p>Hello! My name is Kelly Coomber. I live in Pacific Pines and I
	can teach you or your children to play the piano.</p>

	<p>I have been playing the piano for 22 years, studying privately
	under Narelle Flanagan for some of those.  I have completed
	examinations through the Trinity College London and the Australian
	Music Examinations Board in both Pianoforte and the Theory of Music.
	I have also used my skills to accompany many bands, choirs and soloists 
	in both leisure performance and	competition environments.</p>

	<p>More recently, my passion has evolved to composing original 
	works that focus on the emotive side of music. Some of my original 
	works, along with other performances are available in the media
	section.  In addition to the piano, I have previously studied the flute, 
	bassoon and percussion instruments both privately and through
	the public education system on the Gold Coast.  I was the inaugral 
	recipient of the Palm Beach Currumbin State High School Musical 
	scholarship and graduated from there, receiving the annual award 
	for Excellence in Performing Arts.</p>

	<p> I am qualified to teach beginner to intermediate piano and
	piano for leisure along with offering tuition for early grades of 
	Theory of Music.  I	hold a Blue Card, issued by the Commission for 
	Children, Young People and Child Guardian, Queensland valid until 
	the end of 2013.</p>
