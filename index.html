	<p>Hello! My name is Kelly Coomber. I live in Pacific Plains and I
	can teach you to play the piano.</p>

	<p>I have been playing the piano for 22 years, studying
	under Narelle Flanagan for some of those.  Having completed
	examinations through the Trinity College London and the Australian
	Music Examinations Board in both Pianoforte and the Theory of Music,
	I have accompanied many bands and choirs in both performance and
	competition environments.</p>

	<p>More recently, I have used my skills to compose original works that
	focus on the emotive side of music. Some are available in the media
	section. I am qualified to teach beginner to intermediate piano and
	piano for leisure.</p>
