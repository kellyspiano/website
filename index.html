	<p>Hello! My name is Kelly Coomber. I live in Pacific Pines and I
	can teach you and your children to play the piano.</p>

	<p>I have been playing the piano for 22 years, studying privately
	under Narelle Flanagan for some of those.  I have completed
	examinations through the Trinity College London and the Australian
	Music Examinations Board in both Pianoforte and the Theory of Music.
	I have also used my skills to accompany many bands, choirs and soloists 
	in both leisure performance and	competition environments.</p>

	<p>More recently, my passion has evolved to composing original 
	works that focus on the emotive side of music. Some of my original 
	works, along with other performances are available in the media
	section.  In addition to the piano, I have previously studied the flute, 
	bassoon and percussion instruments.</p>

	<p> I teach beginner to intermediate piano and
	piano for leisure along with offering tuition for early grades of 
	Theory of Music.  I am also available to provide accompaniment for 
	vocalists, choirs and instrumental ensembles.  Please refer to the 
	<a href="tutoring.html">tutoring</a> or 
	<a href="accompaniment.html">accompaniment</a> pages for more information.</p>

	<p>	I hold a Blue Card, issued by the Commission for 
	Children, Young People and Child Guardian, Queensland valid until 
	the end of 2013. Kelly's Piano is a registered business name in Queensland.  
	The ABN for Kelly's Piano is 19 526 644 544.</p>
