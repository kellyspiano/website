	<h1>Tutoring and fees</h1>
	
	<div id="pagecontent">
	<p>Kelly's Piano is located at Pacific Pines on the Gold Coast,
	Queensland. Lessons are offered in a home environment.  I currently teach on a <a href="http://www.kawai.de/cn41_en.htm">Kawai CN41</a>, a full size digital piano with fully weighted keys and an authentic acoustic piano playing experience.  A digital piano allows for the option of recording a
	student's piece, either for playback to friends and family or as an
	opportunity to critque and learn.</p>

	<p>Parents are welcome to remain throughout the lesson, with
    lounge facilities available within the vicinity of the
	piano. </p>

	<p>I adapt my teaching style to suit the learning style of the
	student, ranging from structured workbooks through to using current
	popular music as a means to learn new styles and skills. It is my strong
	belief though that learning the piano is much the same as learning
	any other instrument or skill: to be successful, regular practise is
	vital.</p>
