	<p>Kelly's Piano is located at Pacific Pines on the Gold Coast, Queensland.
	Lessons are offered in a home environment.  I currently teach on a <a
	href="http://www.kawai.de/cn41_en.htm">Kawai CN41</a>, a full size digital
	piano with fully weighted keys and an authentic acoustic piano playing
	experience.  A digital piano allows for the option of recording a student's
	piece, either for playback to friends and family or as an opportunity to
	critque and learn.</p>

	<p>Parents are welcome to remain throughout the lesson, with lounge
	facilities available within the vicinity of the piano. </p>

	<p>I adapt my teaching style to suit the learning style of the
	student, ranging from structured workbooks through to using current
	popular music as a means to learn new styles and skills. It is my strong
	belief though that learning the piano is much the same as learning
	any other instrument or skill: to be successful, regular practise is
	vital.</p>

	<table>
