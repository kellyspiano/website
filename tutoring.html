	<h1>Tutoring and fees</h1>
	
	<div id="pagecontent">
	<p>Kelly's Piano is located at Pacific Pines on the Gold Coast,
	Queensland. Lessons are offered both in this home environment or at a
	student's homes (fees apply).  I currently teach on a Kawai D41
	(check this model number), a full size, fully weighted keys digital
	piano.  Being a digital piano allows for the option of recording a
	student's piece, either for playback to friends and family or as an
	opportunity to critque a performance, as well as feeling and sounding
	like an authentic acoustic piano.</p>

	<p>Parents are welcomed to remain throughout the lesson, with
	comfortable lounge facilities available within the vicinity of the
	piano. </p>

	<p>I adapt my teaching style to suit the learning style of the
	student, ranging from structured workbooks through to using current
	popular music as a means to learn new styles and skills. Her strong
	belief though is that learning the piano is much the same as learning
	any other instrument or skill: to be successful, regular practise is
	vital.</p>
