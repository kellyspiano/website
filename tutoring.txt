Kelly's Piano is located at Pacific Pines on the Gold Coast, Queensland.  Lessons are offered both in this home environment or at a student's homes (fees apply).  Kelly currently teaches on a Kawai D41 (check this model number), a full size, fully weighted keys digital piano.  Being a digital piano allows for the option of recording a student's piece, either for playback to friends and family or as an opportunity to critque a performance, as well as feeling and sounding like an authentic acoustic piano. 

Parents are welcomed to remain throughout the lesson, with comfortable lounge facilities available within the vicinity of the piano. 

Kelly adapts her teaching style to suit the learning style of the student, ranging from structured workbooks through to using current popular music as a means to learn new styles and skills. Her strong belief though is that learning the piano is much the same as learning any other instrument or skill: to be successful, regular practise is vital.
